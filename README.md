# Local Development Setup
Before starting, these components must be installed:
- python
- pip

Contents of requirements.txt:
- numpy
- keras (optional for mnist data)

Start by cloning this repository into a local folder/directory:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/wylieglover/NeuralNetwork-From-Scratch.git
```

Navigate into the repository's folder and run the command below to download the necessary components:
```sh
